### What is Dataset Forge?

Dataset Forge is a modular Python CLI tool for managing, analyzing, and transforming image datasets, with a focus on HQ/LQ pairs for super-resolution and ML workflows.

### What platforms are supported?

- Windows (primary)
- Linux (not yet tested)
- macOS (not yet tested)

### What Python version is required?

Python 3.12+ is recommended. The project supports Python 3.8+ but is tested on 3.12.

### How do I install Dataset Forge and its dependencies?

See the [Quick Start](../README.md#-quick-start) and [Special Installation Instructions](special_installation.md).

### Why do I need to install VapourSynth before getnative?

getnative depends on VapourSynth. If VapourSynth is not installed first, getnative will fail to import or function. See [Special Installation Instructions](special_installation.md).

### How do I fix python-magic errors on Windows?

You must copy the required DLLs from `assets/libmagicwin64-master.zip` to `C:/Windows/System32/`. See [Special Installation Instructions](special_installation.md).

### How do I run the test suite?

Activate the virtual environment and run `pytest`. See [usage.md](usage.md).

### How do I use the monitoring and analytics features?

Access the System Monitoring menu from the CLI to view live resource usage, error tracking, analytics, and health checks. See [features.md](features.md).

### What should I do if I get CUDA or GPU errors?

- Ensure your CUDA and cuDNN versions match your PyTorch install.
- Close other GPU-intensive applications.
- Lower batch size or use CPU fallback if you run out of memory.
- See [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md).

### What if a menu or feature is missing or crashes?

- Make sure you are running the latest version.
- Check the logs in the `./logs/` directory for error details.
- See [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) for solutions to common issues.
