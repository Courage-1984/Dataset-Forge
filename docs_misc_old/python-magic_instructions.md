pip install python-magic python-magic-bin libmagic

.\assets\libmagicwin64-master.zip contains:
    libgnurx-0.dll
    magic.mgc
    magic1.dll
These files should go in C:/Windows/System32/

These files  are for using libmagic with 64 bit Windows and were compiled using MSYS2. Hopefully this will save someone else a lot of pain. Huge thanks to the MSYS2 folks because getting the tool chain to build this natively was a horrible pain.

Drop the dlls in C:\Windows\System32 and python magic will import correctly.

file_magic = magic.Magic(magic_file="c:\path\to\magic.mgc")
