# OpenModelDB Advanced Features (Planned)

This document outlines advanced features for the OpenModelDB Model Management system in Dataset Forge. These are planned for future implementation.

## 1. Model Comparison Tool

- Side-by-side testing of different models on the same image(s)
- Visual and quantitative comparison (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, etc.)
- User-selectable metrics and display options

## 2. Batch Processing

- Process entire folders or datasets with a selected model
- Parallel processing and memory management
- Progress tracking and error reporting

## 3. Performance Metrics

- Track and display model inference speed (images/sec, time per image)
- Quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, FID, etc.)
- Store results for later review

## 4. Model Caching & Offline Management

- Local cache of model metadata and files
- Offline browsing and usage
- Cache management tools (clear, update, prune)

## 5. Advanced Filtering & Search

- Complex queries (multiple tags, architectures, etc.)
- Saved searches and favorites
- User-defined model collections

## 6. Model Training Integration

- Direct training pipeline for new models
- Fine-tuning existing models with user data
- Integration with Spandrel and other frameworks

## 7. UI/UX Enhancements

- CLI-interactive browser (arrow keys, live search)
- Richer model info display (images, graphs)
- Export/import model lists
