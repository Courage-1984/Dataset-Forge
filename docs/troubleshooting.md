# Troubleshooting

This guide provides solutions to common issues in Dataset Forge. For advanced usage and developer troubleshooting, see [advanced.md](advanced.md).

---

## Dependancy & Library Issues

**Problem:** Import errors or menu options not working.

- Please see: [Special Installation Instructions](troubleshooting.md)

## Menu Timing & Profiling Issues

**Problem:** Timing prints do not appear after loading a menu or submenu.

- Ensure you are running the latest version of Dataset Forge.
- Check that the menu or submenu uses the `time_and_record_menu_load` utility.
- "Back" and "Exit" options do not trigger timing prints.

## Menu Loop Issues

**Problem:** Errors occur when navigating menus (e.g., `TypeError: 'str' object is not callable`).

- All menu loops should check if the action is callable before calling it.
- Update your menu code to follow the robust menu loop pattern (see [style_guide.md](style_guide.md)).

**Problem:** Menu redraws repeatedly or submenus do not appear.

- Ensure the menu loop uses the robust pattern:
  - Get the user's choice (key) from `show_menu`.
  - Look up the action in the options dictionary.
  - Call the action if callable.

## Other Issues

- For monitoring/analytics issues, check the logs in the ./logs/ directory.
- If tests fail, ensure your environment matches the requirements and all dependencies are installed.

## Test Failures

- If you encounter a failing test, check for function signature mismatches, especially with parallel utilities that pass extra kwargs (e.g., play_audio).
- Ensure all monkeypatches and fixtures match the expected types and return values.

## üß™ Test Suite Troubleshooting (July 2025)

- **Monkeypatch signature mismatch:** Ensure dummy functions/classes accept all arguments used in the real code (e.g., `color=None`, `**kwargs`).
- **Multiprocessing pickling errors:** Worker functions must be defined at module level, not nested inside other functions.
- **XFAIL tests:** Some tests (e.g., ignore patterns in directory tree) are marked XFAIL by design; see docs for details.

See [Style Guide](style_guide.md#testing-patterns) and [features.md](features.md#comprehensive-test-suite).

## Static Analysis Tool Issues

**Problem:** The static analysis script (`tools/find_code_issues/find_code_issues.py`) fails to run, or you get unexpected results.

- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install vulture pytest pytest-cov coverage pyan3 pyflakes`
- If you get import errors, check your virtual environment and Python version.
- If the script reports no files found, check your directory structure and that the codebase is present.
- The script overwrites its output files in `tools/find_code_issues/` on each run.
- Review the log file (`find_code_issues.log`) for detailed error messages.

## Metadata Management Issues (NEW July 2025)

**Problem:** exiftool not found or not working.

- Ensure exiftool is installed and in your system PATH. Download from https://exiftool.org/.
- On Windows, you may need to rename exiftool(-k).exe to exiftool.exe and add its folder to PATH.
- Restart your terminal after installation.

**Problem:** pandas or SQLite errors when extracting/filtering metadata.

- Ensure pandas is installed: `pip install pandas`
- SQLite is included with Python, but ensure your Python is not missing standard libraries.
- Check your CSV/SQLite file for corruption or incomplete extraction.

**Problem:** Metadata extraction returns empty or incomplete results.

- Some image formats may not contain metadata, or may be corrupted.
- Try running exiftool manually on a sample file to debug.
- Check file permissions and ensure files are not locked by another process.

## Utility Scripts (tools/) Troubleshooting

### find_code_issues.py

- **Problem:** Script fails to run, or you get unexpected results.
  - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install vulture pytest pytest-cov coverage pyan3 pyflakes`
  - If you get import errors, check your virtual environment and Python version.
  - If the script reports no files found, check your directory structure and that the codebase is present.
  - The script overwrites its output files in `tools/find_code_issues/` on each run.
  - Review the log file (`find_code_issues.log`) for detailed error messages.

### merge_docs.py

- **Problem:** Documentation files are missing or not merged.
  - Ensure all documentation files exist and are readable.
  - If you see missing file warnings, check the `DOC_ORDER` list in the script.
  - If output files are not updated, check file permissions in the docs/ directory.

### install.py

- **Problem:** Python version is too low.
  - Upgrade to Python 3.12+.
- **Problem:** CUDA-enabled torch fails to install.
  - Check your CUDA version and use the correct index URL for torch.
- **Problem:** pip install fails.
  - Check your internet connection and permissions.
  - Try running the command as administrator or with sudo (Linux/Mac).

### print_zsteg_env.py

- **Problem:** `zsteg` is not found.
  - Ensure `zsteg` is installed and in your PATH.
  - On Windows, you may need to restart your terminal after adding to PATH.
- **Problem:** PATH is not updated.
  - Double-check your environment variable settings and restart your terminal.
