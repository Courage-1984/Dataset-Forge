# Project Architecture

(Include the full "Modular Architecture" and "Project Structure" sections from the original README here, preserving formatting and navigation.)

## Monitoring & Analytics Architecture

- **dataset_forge/utils/monitoring.py**: Centralized resource monitoring, analytics, error tracking, health checks, and background task registry. Provides decorators and context managers for integration with all action modules. Handles persistent logging and notifications.
- **dataset_forge/menus/system_monitoring_menu.py**: CLI menu for live resource usage, analytics, error summaries, health checks, and background task management. Integrates with monitoring.py and is accessible from the main menu.

All major operations in actions/ are instrumented with monitoring/analytics hooks, and memory/CUDA cleanup is integrated throughout the app lifecycle.

## Audio Error Feedback

The CLI interface now provides audio error feedback: whenever an error is reported to the user (via print_error), an error sound (error.mp3) is played for immediate feedback. This is handled by the centralized print_error utility in utils/printing.py, which calls play_error_sound from utils/audio_utils.py.

## Menu System, Robust Loop, and Timing

The menu system uses a robust loop pattern and integrates timing/profiling for all menu and submenu loads. This ensures reliability and performance.

## Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)

CBIR is integrated as a modular component for semantic duplicate detection.

## Monitoring, Analytics & Error Tracking

Monitoring and analytics are integrated throughout the architecture for performance and error tracking.

## Test Suite

The test suite is integrated to cover all major architectural components.
