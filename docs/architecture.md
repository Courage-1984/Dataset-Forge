# Project Architecture

Dataset Forge is built with a modular, extensible architecture for maintainability and performance.

## Directory Structure

- **menus/**: UI layer (CLI menus, user interaction)
- **actions/**: Business logic (core dataset/image operations)
- **utils/**: Reusable utilities (file ops, memory, parallelism, color, monitoring, etc.)
- **dpid/**: Multiple DPID (degradation) implementations
- **configs/**: Example and user configuration files
- **reports/**: Report templates for HTML/Markdown output

## Monitoring & Analytics

- Centralized resource monitoring, analytics, error tracking, health checks, and background task registry (see utils/monitoring.py).
- CLI menu for live resource usage, analytics, error summaries, health checks, and background task management (see menus/system_monitoring_menu.py).
- Persistent logging and notifications for all major operations.

## Test Suite Integration

- Comprehensive automated test suite using pytest.
- Covers CLI, menu timing, error feedback, memory, parallelism, and file/image utilities.
