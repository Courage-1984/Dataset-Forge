# Usage Guide

> **UI/UX Note:**  
> All CLI output in Dataset Forge uses the Catppuccin Mocha color scheme for a consistent, visually appealing experience. All prompts, menus, and progress bars are styled using the centralized color utilities.

## Quick Reference

- Clean, organize, and validate image datasets (HQ/LQ pairs, deduplication, quality scoring)
- Run advanced augmentations, transformations, and batch processing
- Analyze datasets and generate reports
- Integrate with external tools and leverage GPU acceleration
- Modular CLI with styled workflows and audio feedback

## Global Commands & Menu Navigation

Dataset Forge supports comprehensive global commands for a seamless CLI experience:

### **Available Global Commands**

- **help, h, ?** — Show context-aware help for the current menu, including navigation tips and available options.
- **quit, exit, q** — Instantly exit Dataset Forge from any menu, with full memory and resource cleanup.
- **0** — Go back to the previous menu (as before).
- **Ctrl+C** — Emergency exit with cleanup.

### **User Experience Features**

- **Context-Aware Help**: Each menu provides specific help information with purpose, options, navigation instructions, key features, and helpful tips
- **Automatic Menu Redraw**: After using `help`, the menu is automatically redrawn for clarity
- **Consistent Styling**: All prompts and help screens use the Catppuccin Mocha color scheme
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup on quit with proper resource management
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases and invalid inputs
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 71 tests covering all global command functionality

### **Example Usage**

```
Enter your choice: help
# ...context-aware help screen appears with menu-specific information...
Press Enter to continue...
# Menu is automatically redrawn
Enter your choice: quit
# Dataset Forge exits with full cleanup
```

### **Technical Implementation**

The global command system is built on:
- **Core Files**: `dataset_forge/utils/menu.py` and `dataset_forge/utils/help_system.py`
- **Menu Integration**: All menus include `current_menu` and `menu_context` parameters
- **Help Documentation**: Comprehensive help content in `menu_system/comprehensive_help_menu.md` (31,665 bytes)
- **Testing Coverage**: Unit tests, integration tests, and edge case testing for all functionality

## Main Workflows

### 📂 Dataset Management

- **Create, combine, split, and shuffle datasets** from the Dataset Management menu.
- **Deduplicate, batch rename, and filter images** using Clean & Organize.
- **Align images** (Batch Projective Alignment) for HQ/LQ pairs or multi-source datasets.

### 🔍 Analysis & Validation

- **Validate datasets and HQ/LQ pairs** from the Analysis & Validation menu.
- **Run quality scoring and outlier detection** to assess dataset quality.
- **Generate HTML/Markdown reports** with plots and sample images.

### ✨ Augmentation & Processing

- **Apply augmentations, tiling, and batch processing** from the Augmentation and Image Processing menus.
- **Resave images, convert formats, and apply basic transformations** (crop, flip, rotate, grayscale, etc.).
- **Use advanced pipelines and recipes** for complex augmentation workflows.

### 🩺 Monitoring & Utilities

- **Monitor live resource usage, error tracking, and analytics** from the System Monitoring menu.
- **Manage cache** (view stats, clear, optimize) from System Settings → Cache Management.
- **Use utility scripts** in the `tools/` directory for environment setup, static analysis, and troubleshooting.

### 🧪 Testing & Developer Tools

- **Run all tests** with `python tools/run_tests.py` (see [getting_started.md](getting_started.md) for details).
- **Use static analysis tools** for code quality (`tools/find_code_issues/find_code_issues.py`).
- **Audit menu hierarchy** with `python tools/log_current_menu.py` for menu system analysis and improvement recommendations.
- **All major features provide public, non-interactive APIs** for programmatic use and testing.

### 🔧 Enhanced Development with MCP Integration

Dataset Forge is configured with three MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for enhanced development:

- **Filesystem MCP**: Direct access to codebase and datasets for navigation and analysis
- **Brave Search MCP**: Privacy-focused web research for ML techniques and tools
- **Firecrawl MCP**: Web scraping for documentation and resource extraction

**Development Workflow:**
```bash
# Enhanced Development Routine
1. Use Filesystem MCP to navigate and analyze codebase
2. Use Brave Search to research new ML techniques and tools
3. Use Firecrawl to extract relevant documentation and resources
4. Implement improvements based on research findings
5. Update documentation with new insights and techniques
```

See [Advanced Features](advanced.md) for detailed MCP integration information and technical implementation examples.

## Example: Running a Workflow

```bash
dataset-forge
# or
py main.py
```

- Select a menu option (e.g., Dataset Management, Analysis & Validation).
- Follow the prompts for input/output folders, options, and confirmation.
- Progress bars and styled prompts guide you through each step.
- Audio feedback signals completion or errors.
