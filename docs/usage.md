## Menu Timing & Profiling

Whenever you load a menu or submenu in Dataset Forge, you will see a timing print in the CLI, such as:

    ‚è±Ô∏è Loaded dataset_management_menu in 0.123 seconds.

This print uses the Catppuccin Mocha color scheme for clarity and consistency.

All menu load times are recorded. To view a summary of all menu/submenu load timings:

1. Go to the **System Monitoring** menu from the main menu.
2. Select **"‚è±Ô∏è View Menu Load Times"**.
3. You will see a table of all menu/submenu load times for your session.

This helps you identify slow-loading menus and optimize your workflow.
