# 🩺 Dataset Health Scoring (NEW July 2025)

**Location:** Dataset Management menu → 🩺 Dataset Health Scoring

**Purpose:**

- Assess the overall health and readiness of an image dataset for ML workflows.
- Supports both single-folder datasets and HQ/LQ parent folder structures (for super-resolution and paired tasks).

**Workflow:**

- User selects either a single folder or an HQ/LQ parent folder (auto-detects or prompts for HQ/LQ subfolders).
- Runs a series of modular checks:
  - Basic validation (file existence, supported formats, min count)
  - Unreadable/corrupt files
  - Image format consistency
  - Quality metrics (resolution, blur, etc.)
  - Aspect ratio consistency
  - File size outliers
  - Consistency checks (duplicates, naming, alignment)
  - Compliance scan (metadata, forbidden content)
- Each check is weighted; partial credit is possible.
- Shows a detailed breakdown of results, a final health score (0–100), and a status (✅ Production Ready, ⚠️ Needs Improvement, ❌ Unusable).
- Provides actionable suggestions for improvement if any step fails.

**Extensibility:**

- Checks are modular; new steps can be added easily.
- Scoring weights and logic are configurable in the business logic module.

**Testing:**

- Fully covered by unit and integration tests (see `tests/test_utils/test_dataset_health_scoring.py` and `tests/test_cli/test_dataset_health_scoring_menu.py`).
- Tests simulate both single-folder and HQ/LQ menu flows, including edge cases and input handling.

**Robustness:**

- Uses centralized input, printing, memory, and error handling utilities.
- Follows the robust menu loop and lazy import patterns.
- CLI integration is non-blocking and fully automated for testing.

# 🔊 Project Sounds & Audio Feedback

Dataset Forge uses a robust multi-library audio system to provide immediate feedback for key events. The system intelligently selects the best audio library for each platform and file format, ensuring reliable playback across different environments.

## Audio System Architecture

The audio system uses multiple libraries with intelligent fallbacks:

1. **Playsound (1.2.2)** - Primary cross-platform library

   - Most reliable for various audio formats
   - Good cross-platform support
   - Handles MP3, WAV, and other formats

2. **Winsound** - Windows WAV files optimization

   - Best performance for WAV files on Windows
   - Native Windows audio system
   - Fastest playback for short sounds

3. **Pydub** - Various format support

   - Excellent for MP3 and other formats
   - Good cross-platform compatibility
   - Advanced audio processing capabilities

4. **Pygame** - Cross-platform fallback
   - Reliable fallback option
   - Good for longer audio files
   - Thread-safe operations

## Audio Files

| Sound    | File         | Size      | When it Plays                                 | Meaning for User                 |
| -------- | ------------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Startup  | startup.mp3  | 78,240 B  | When the application starts                   | App is ready to use              |
| Success  | done.wav     | 352,844 B | After long or successful operations           | Operation completed successfully |
| Error    | error.mp3    | 32,600 B  | On any user-facing error or failed operation  | Attention: an error occurred     |
| Shutdown | shutdown.mp3 | 23,808 B  | When the application exits (normal or Ctrl+C) | App is shutting down             |

## Audio System Features

- **System-specific optimization**: Different libraries for different platforms
- **Format-specific handling**: Optimized playback for WAV vs MP3 files
- **Graceful fallbacks**: Multiple fallback options if primary method fails
- **Non-blocking playback**: Timeout protection to prevent hanging
- **Thread-safe operations**: Safe for concurrent audio playback
- **Error resilience**: Continues operation even if audio fails

## Audio Usage

```python
from dataset_forge.utils.audio_utils import (
    play_done_sound,
    play_error_sound,
    play_startup_sound,
    play_shutdown_sound
)

# Play audio with automatic fallback handling
play_done_sound(block=True)      # Success feedback
play_error_sound(block=True)     # Error feedback
play_startup_sound(block=False)  # Non-blocking startup
play_shutdown_sound(block=True)  # Exit feedback
```

## Audio System Benefits

- **Reliable playback**: Multiple fallback options ensure audio works across platforms
- **No hanging**: Timeout protection prevents CLI from hanging during audio playback
- **Fast startup**: Optimized library selection for quick audio response
- **Error resilience**: CLI continues working even if audio system fails
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux with appropriate libraries

- All user-facing errors always trigger the error sound for immediate notification.
- Success and error sounds are also used in progress bars and batch operations.
- Sounds are played using the centralized audio utilities (see [Style Guide](style_guide.md#audio--user-feedback)).
- The audio system gracefully handles failures and continues operation even if audio playback fails.

These sounds help you know instantly when an operation finishes, fails, or the app starts/stops—no need to watch the screen at all times.

- **FAISS Integration**: Efficient similarity search with graceful fallback to optimized matrix computation
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for empty embeddings, failed operations, and memory issues
- **Process Pool Management**: Automatic cleanup and proper termination to prevent memory leaks

#### **🔧 Memory Management**
- **Chunked Embedding Computation**: `Processing 4581 images in 11 chunks of size 458`
- **Automatic Memory Cleanup**: Explicit memory clearing after each chunk
- **Model Initialization**: Models loaded once at module import time into global cache
- **Fallback Systems**: Graceful degradation when FAISS or models are unavailable
- **Large Dataset Handling**: `Large dataset detected (4581 images), using chunked similarity computation`

#### **📊 Results & Performance**
- **✅ 4,581 images loaded successfully** from folder
- **✅ All images processed without errors**
- **✅ No duplicate groups found** (unique images confirmed)
- **✅ Complete workflow execution** from start to finish
- **✅ Production-ready status** achieved

### **Workflow Options**

#### **1. CLIP Embedding (Fast, Semantic)**
- **Speed**: ~10 images/second processing rate
- **Method**: Uses CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) for semantic similarity
- **Best For**: Finding semantically similar images (same content, different styles)
- **Optimization**: Chunked processing with automatic memory management

#### **2. LPIPS (Slow, Perceptual)**

- **Method**: Uses LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) for perceptual similarity
- **Best For**: Finding visually identical or very similar images
- **Optimization**: Single-threaded processing for large datasets to avoid memory issues

### **Technical Implementation**

#### **Chunked Processing Architecture**
```python
# Automatic chunk size calculation based on dataset size
chunk_size = get_optimal_chunk_size(total_images, max_workers=2)

# Sequential chunk processing with memory cleanup
for chunk_idx, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
    process_chunk_with_memory_management(chunk)
    clear_memory()  # Automatic cleanup after each chunk
```

#### **Memory Management Strategy**
- **Global Model Cache**: Models loaded once per process to avoid repeated loading
- **Chunked Processing**: Large datasets divided into manageable chunks
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Memory cleared after each chunk to prevent accumulation
- **Process Pool Management**: Proper termination to prevent memory leaks

#### **Error Handling & Fallbacks**
- **Empty Embeddings**: Comprehensive checks for empty results before processing
- **Model Loading**: Graceful fallback to hash-based embeddings if CLIP unavailable
- **FAISS Integration**: Falls back to optimized matrix computation if FAISS unavailable
- **Memory Issues**: Automatic detection and handling of memory constraints
