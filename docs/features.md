```

This script provides a menu to select the test mode, or you can pass an option (see below). See [usage.md](usage.md#🦾-running-the-test-suite) for details.

**Test suite highlights:**

- All features have public, non-interactive APIs for programmatic access and testing.
- Tests use monkeypatching and dummy objects to avoid reliance on external binaries or real files.
- Multiprocessing tests use module-level worker functions for compatibility.
- Only one test is marked XFAIL (ignore patterns in directory tree), which is expected and documented.

See [Usage Guide](usage.md#testing) and [Style Guide](style_guide.md#testing-patterns) for details.

## Testing & Validation

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Tools: Static Analysis & Code Quality

> **Documentation Convention:** When adding new features or modules, update the architecture diagrams (Mermaid) in README.md and docs/architecture.md as needed. Use standard badges in the README and document their meaning in the docs.

- **Static Analysis Tool:** Located at `tools/find_code_issues/find_code_issues.py`.
- **Checks:**
  - Unused (dead) code, functions, classes, and methods
  - Untested code (missing test coverage)
  - Functions/classes defined but never called
  - Test/code mapping (tests without code, code without tests)
  - Missing docstrings in public functions/classes/methods
  - Unused imports/variables, and more
- **How to run:**
  ```sh
  python tools/find_code_issues/find_code_issues.py [options]
  # Run with no options to perform all checks
  ```
- **Output:**
  - Overwrites files in `tools/find_code_issues/` on each run:
    - `find_code_issues.log` (raw output)
    - `find_code_issues_report.txt` (actionable summary)
    - `find_code_issues_view.txt` (detailed results)
- **Requirements:**
  - `

## 🛠️ Utility Scripts (tools/)

Dataset Forge includes several utility scripts in the `tools/` directory to assist with development, documentation, and environment setup. These scripts are user-facing and documented in detail in [usage.md](usage.md#utility-scripts-tools).

- **find_code_issues.py**: Comprehensive static analysis tool for code quality and maintainability. Checks for dead code, untested code, missing docstrings, test/code mapping, and more. See [usage.md](usage.md#find_code_issuespy-static-analysis-tool) for full usage and options.
- **merge_docs.py**: Merges all documentation files in `docs/` into a single `README_full.md` and generates a hierarchical Table of Contents (`toc.md`). Keeps documentation in sync. See [usage.md](usage.md#merge_docspy-documentation-merging-tool).
- **install.py**: Automated environment setup script. Creates a virtual environment, installs CUDA-enabled torch, and installs all project requirements. See [usage.md](usage.md#installpy-environment-setup-tool).

# 🩺 Dataset Health Scoring (NEW July 2025)

**Location:** Dataset Management menu → 🩺 Dataset Health Scoring

**Purpose:**

- Assess the overall health and readiness of an image dataset for ML workflows.
- Supports both single-folder datasets and HQ/LQ parent folder structures (for super-resolution and paired tasks).

**Workflow:**

- User selects either a single folder or an HQ/LQ parent folder (auto-detects or prompts for HQ/LQ subfolders).
- Runs a series of modular checks:
  - Basic validation (file existence, supported formats, min count)
  - Unreadable/corrupt files
  - Image format consistency
  - Quality metrics (resolution, blur, etc.)
  - Aspect ratio consistency
  - File size outliers
  - Consistency checks (duplicates, naming, alignment)
  - Compliance scan (metadata, forbidden content)
- Each check is weighted; partial credit is possible.
- Shows a detailed breakdown of results, a final health score (0–100), and a status (✅ Production Ready, ⚠️ Needs Improvement, ❌ Unusable).
- Provides actionable suggestions for improvement if any step fails.

**Extensibility:**

- Checks are modular; new steps can be added easily.
- Scoring weights and logic are configurable in the business logic module.

**Testing:**

- Fully covered by unit and integration tests (see `tests/test_utils/test_dataset_health_scoring.py` and `tests/test_cli/test_dataset_health_scoring_menu.py`).
- Tests simulate both single-folder and HQ/LQ menu flows, including edge cases and input handling.

**Robustness:**

- Uses centralized input, printing, memory, and error handling utilities.
- Follows the robust menu loop and lazy import patterns.
- CLI integration is non-blocking and fully automated for testing.

# 🔊 Project Sounds & Audio Feedback

Dataset Forge uses four distinct sounds to provide immediate feedback for key events:

| Sound    | File         | When it Plays                                 | Meaning for User                 |
| -------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Startup  | startup.mp3  | When the application starts                   | App is ready to use              |
| Success  | done.wav     | After long or successful operations           | Operation completed successfully |
| Error    | error.mp3    | On any user-facing error or failed operation  | Attention: an error occurred     |
| Shutdown | shutdown.mp3 | When the application exits (normal or Ctrl+C) | App is shutting down             |

- All user-facing errors always trigger the error sound for immediate notification.
- Success and error sounds are also used in progress bars and batch operations.
- Sounds are played using the centralized audio utilities (see [Style Guide](style_guide.md#audio--user-feedback)).
- (If configurable: You can enable/disable sounds in the user preferences/settings menu.)

These sounds help you know instantly when an operation finishes, fails, or the app starts/stops—no need to watch the screen at all times.
