## Menu Timing & Profiling

Dataset Forge features a fast, responsive CLI menu system with built-in timing and profiling. Every time you load a menu or submenu, a timing print (e.g., `‚è±Ô∏è Loaded dataset_management_menu in 0.123 seconds.`) is shown in the Catppuccin Mocha color scheme. All menu load times are recorded and can be viewed in the System Monitoring menu under "‚è±Ô∏è View Menu Load Times". This helps identify slow-loading menus and provides transparency for performance optimization. The timing system uses lazy imports to maximize CLI speed and minimize memory usage.

## Robust Menu Loop Pattern

All menus and submenus use a robust, standardized menu loop pattern:

- The user's choice (key) is obtained from `show_menu`.
- The action is looked up in the options dictionary.
- The action is called if it is callable.
  This pattern ensures reliable navigation and submenu invocation everywhere. Example:

```python
from dataset_forge.utils.menu import show_menu
from dataset_forge.utils.color import Mocha

def my_menu():
    options = {
        "1": ("üìÇ Option 1", function1),
        "2": ("üîç Option 2", function2),
        "0": ("üö™ Exit", None),
    }
    while True:
        try:
            action = show_menu("Menu Title", options, Mocha.lavender)
            if action is None:
                break
            action()
        except (KeyboardInterrupt, EOFError):
            print_info("\nExiting...")
            break
```

## Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) for Duplicates

CBIR uses deep learning embeddings (CLIP, ResNet, VGG) for semantic duplicate detection. It supports feature extraction, similarity search, ANN indexing, grouping, and batch actions (find, remove, move, copy). Access CBIR features from the Duplicates menu. See the usage guide for workflow details.

## Monitoring, Analytics & Error Tracking

Dataset Forge uses centralized monitoring and analytics utilities. All user-facing and long-running functions are decorated for performance and error tracking. Subprocesses/threads are registered for background task management. Health checks for RAM, disk, CUDA, and permissions are available. Persistent logging of analytics and errors is stored in ./logs/. All monitoring and analytics features are accessible from the System Monitoring menu.

## Test Suite

Dataset Forge includes a comprehensive, automated test suite covering CLI entry and menu navigation, menu timing/profiling, error feedback (including audio), memory management and parallel processing, file and image utilities, and robust handling of Unicode, subprocess, and Windows-specific issues. To run all tests:

```sh
venv312\Scripts\activate
pytest
```

## Dependency Management: Grouped Requirements & Install Order

The `requirements.txt` is grouped and commented for clarity. Please install VapourSynth before getnative, and install the correct CUDA-enabled torch/torchvision/torchaudio before running `pip install .`. See the advanced guide for details.

## Robust Menu Loop Pattern (July 2025)

All menus and submenus now use a robust, standardized menu loop pattern:

- The user's choice (key) is obtained from `show_menu`.
- The action is looked up in the options dictionary.
- The action is called if it is callable.
- This pattern is applied globally, ensuring reliable navigation and submenu invocation everywhere.
- No more redraw bugs or dead options‚Äîevery menu and submenu works as intended.

This pattern complements the lazy import and timing/profiling systems, maximizing CLI speed, reliability, and user experience.

See [docs/usage.md](usage.md) and [docs/advanced.md](advanced.md) for implementation details and code examples.
