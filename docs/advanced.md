# Advanced Features & Configuration

This document covers advanced usage, configuration, and developer patterns for Dataset Forge. For user-facing features, see [features.md](features.md).

---

## Advanced Configuration

- **Custom config files**: Use JSON, YAML, or HCL for advanced workflows.
- **Integration with external tools**: [WTP Dataset Destroyer](https://github.com/umzi2/wtp_dataset_destroyer), [traiNNer-redux](https://github.com/the-database/traiNNer-redux), [getnative](https://github.com/Infiziert90/getnative), [resdet](https://github.com/0x09/resdet)
- **Batch processing and memory optimization**: Tune batch sizes and memory settings in the config files for large datasets.
- **OpenModelDB integration**: Advanced model management and upscaling workflows.

## Advanced Monitoring & Analytics

- **Add new analytics hooks**: Decorate new actions with `@monitor_performance` and `@track_errors`.
- **Background task management**: Register new subprocesses/threads for monitoring.
- **Persistent logging**: Ensure all analytics and errors are logged to ./logs/.
