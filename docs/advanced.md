# Advanced Features & Configuration

> **Who is this for?**  
> This guide is for advanced users, power users, and contributors who want to customize, extend, or deeply understand Dataset Forge. For user-facing features, see [features.md](features.md).

---

## Advanced Configuration

- Use custom config files (JSON, YAML, HCL) for advanced workflows.
- Integrate with external tools (WTP Dataset Destroyer, traiNNer-redux, getnative, resdet, etc.).
- Tune batch sizes, memory, and parallelism for large datasets.
- Advanced model management and upscaling with OpenModelDB.

---

## Performance & Optimization

- GPU acceleration for image processing (PyTorch, TorchVision).
- Distributed processing with Dask and Ray.
- Advanced caching: in-memory, disk, model, and smart auto-selection.
- JIT compilation (Numba, Cython, PyTorch JIT) for performance-critical code.
- Quality-based sample prioritization and adaptive batching.

<details>
<summary><strong>Technical Implementation: Caching System</strong></summary>

- In-memory, disk, and model caches with TTL, compression, and statistics.
- Decorators: `@in_memory_cache`, `@disk_cache`, `@model_cache`, `@smart_cache`.
- Programmatic management: clear, validate, repair, warmup, export cache.
- See code samples in the full file for usage.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Technical Implementation: Performance Suite</strong></summary>

- GPUImageProcessor, distributed_map, multi_gpu_map, prioritize_samples, compile_function, etc.
- See code samples in the full file for usage.

</details>

## Developer Patterns & Extending

- **Robust menu loop pattern** for all CLI menus.
- Modular integration of new workflows (e.g., Umzi's Dataset_Preprocessing, resave images).
- All business logic in `dataset_forge/actions/`, menus in `dataset_forge/menus/`.
- Lazy imports for fast CLI responsiveness.
- Centralized utilities for printing, memory, error handling, and progress.

<details>
<summary><strong>Static Analysis & Utility Scripts</strong></summary>

- `tools/find_code_issues/find_code_issues.py`: dead code, coverage, docstrings, test mapping, etc.
- `tools/log_current_menu.py`: comprehensive menu hierarchy analysis, path input detection, and improvement recommendations
- `tools/merge_docs.py`: merges docs and generates ToC.
- `tools/install.py`: automated environment setup.
- All new scripts must be documented and tested.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Menu Auditing Tool</strong></summary>

The menu auditing tool (`tools/log_current_menu.py`) provides comprehensive analysis of Dataset Forge's menu hierarchy:

**Key Features:**

- **Recursive Exploration**: Automatically discovers and explores all menus and submenus (up to 4 levels deep)
- **Path Input Detection**: Identifies menus requiring user path input using regex patterns
- **AST-Based Analysis**: Uses Python's Abstract Syntax Tree for accurate code parsing with regex fallback
- **Function Resolution**: Handles complex menu function references including `lazy_menu()` calls
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed markdown reports with statistics and recommendations

**Usage:**

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
venv312\Scripts\activate

# Run the menu audit
python tools/log_current_menu.py
```

**Output:** Generates `menu_system/current_menu.md` with:

- Executive summary and statistics
- Hierarchical menu tree structure
- Detailed analysis of each menu
- Actionable recommendations for improvement
- Menu depth, size, and path input metrics

**Configuration:** Customizable settings for output location, maximum depth, and path input detection patterns.

## Advanced Testing Patterns

- All features provide public, non-interactive APIs for programmatic use and testing.
- Tests use pytest, fixtures, monkeypatching, and dummy objects.
- Multiprocessing tests require module-level worker functions.
- All new features and bugfixes must include robust tests.

---

## Technical Deep Dives

<details>
<summary><strong>DPID Modular Integration</strong></summary>

- Multiple DPID (degradation) methods: BasicSR, OpenMMLab, Phhofm, Umzi.
- Modular, public APIs for both single-folder and HQ/LQ paired workflows.
- All implementations are robustly tested.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Enhanced Metadata Management</strong></summary>

- Uses exiftool for robust, cross-format metadata extraction, editing, and anonymization.
- Batch extract, view/edit, filter, and anonymize metadata.
- Integration with pandas/SQLite for scalable analysis.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Resave Images Integration</strong></summary>

- Modular, maintainable feature with thread-based parallel processing.
- Supports multiple output formats, grayscale, recursive processing, and unique filenames.
- Fully covered by unit and integration tests.

</details>

## Planned/Future Advanced Features

- Advanced options for Align Images (SIFT/FLANN parameters, etc.).
- Further modularization and extensibility for new workflows.
- More advanced analytics and monitoring.
