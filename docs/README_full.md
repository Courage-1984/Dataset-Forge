## What is Dataset Forge?

**Dataset Forge** is a professional-grade Python CLI utility for managing, analyzing, and transforming image datasets‚Äîespecially High-Quality (HQ) and Low-Quality (LQ) pairs for super-resolution (SISR) and general computer vision tasks. It is designed for ML researchers and data scientists who need:

- Powerful dataset curation, validation, and cleaning tools
- Deep analysis and reporting for dataset quality
- Advanced image processing, augmentation, and transformation
- A beautiful, user-friendly CLI with progress tracking and memory management

**Key Use Cases:**

- Preparing HQ/LQ datasets for super-resolution training
- Validating, cleaning, and analyzing large image datasets
- Running advanced deduplication, tiling, and augmentation pipelines
- Generating rich reports and statistics for ML workflows

---

## üèóÔ∏è Modular Architecture (Summary)

Dataset Forge is built with a modular, extensible architecture:

- **menus/**: UI layer (CLI menus, user interaction)
- **actions/**: Business logic (core dataset/image operations)
- **utils/**: Reusable utilities (file ops, memory, parallelism, color, monitoring, etc.)
- **dpid/**: Multiple DPID (degradation) implementations
- **configs/**: Example and user configuration files
- **reports/**: Report templates for HTML/Markdown output

See [Project Architecture](#project-architecture) for details.

## Fast CLI Menus with Lazy Imports (Updated)

Dataset Forge now uses a comprehensive lazy import pattern for all main menus and submenus. This means:

- **Heavy modules and actions are only imported when the user selects a menu option.**
- The CLI main menu and all submenus are now extremely fast and responsive, even as the project grows.
- The `lazy_action()` helper is used throughout menu files to wrap actions and submenu calls, ensuring imports are deferred until needed.
- This pattern is applied to: main menu, dataset management, analysis & validation, image processing, system monitoring, model management, and more.

**Why?**

- Python imports can be slow, especially with large dependencies (e.g., torch, PIL, OpenCV).
- Lazy imports keep the CLI snappy and reduce memory usage.

**How to use in new menus:**

- Use the `lazy_action(module_path, func_name)` helper to wrap any action or submenu that imports heavy modules.
- See `dataset_forge/menus/main_menu.py` and other menu files for examples.

This is now the recommended pattern for all new menu and action integrations.

## Robust Menu Loop Pattern (July 2025)

All menus and submenus now use a robust, standardized menu loop pattern:

- The user's choice (key) is obtained from `show_menu`.
- The action is looked up in the options dictionary.
- The action is called if it is callable.
- This pattern is applied globally, ensuring reliable navigation and submenu invocation everywhere.
- No more redraw bugs or dead options‚Äîevery menu and submenu works as intended.

This pattern complements the lazy import and timing/profiling systems, maximizing CLI speed, reliability, and user experience.

(Include the full "Modular Architecture" and "Project Structure" sections from the original README here, preserving formatting and navigation.)

## Monitoring & Analytics Architecture

- **dataset_forge/utils/monitoring.py**: Centralized resource monitoring, analytics, error tracking, health checks, and background task registry. Provides decorators and context managers for integration with all action modules. Handles persistent logging and notifications.
- **dataset_forge/menus/system_monitoring_menu.py**: CLI menu for live resource usage, analytics, error summaries, health checks, and background task management. Integrates with monitoring.py and is accessible from the main menu.

All major operations in actions/ are instrumented with monitoring/analytics hooks, and memory/CUDA cleanup is integrated throughout the app lifecycle.

## Audio Error Feedback

The CLI interface now provides audio error feedback: whenever an error is reported to the user (via print_error), an error sound (error.mp3) is played for immediate feedback. This is handled by the centralized print_error utility in utils/printing.py, which calls play_error_sound from utils/audio_utils.py.

## General Principles

- **Python 3.8+**. Use modern Python features.
- **PEP 8** style, 4-space indentation, 88-char line length (Black standard).
- **Google-style docstrings** for all public functions/classes.
- **Type hints** for all function parameters and return values.
- **Absolute imports** for all `dataset_forge` modules.
- **Modular design**: UI (menus/), business logic (actions/), utilities (utils/), DPID (dpid/).

## Project Architecture

- See [Project Architecture](architecture.md) for directory structure and modularity.
- Keep UI, logic, and utilities separate.
- Use thin UI layers (menus), business logic in actions, helpers in utils.

## Coding Standards

- PEP 8, 4-space indent, 88-char lines.
- Use type hints everywhere.
- Google-style docstrings (see below).
- Example:

```python
def process_images(image_paths: List[str], output_dir: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Process a list of images and save results to output directory.

    Args:
        image_paths: List of input image file paths
        output_dir: Directory to save processed images

    Returns:
        List of output image file paths

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If input files don't exist
        PermissionError: If output directory is not writable

    Example:
        >>> paths = process_images(['img1.jpg', 'img2.png'], 'output/')
        >>> print(f"Processed {len(paths)} images")
    """
```

## Import Organization

1. Standard library
2. Third-party
3. Local imports (`dataset_forge.*`)
4. Relative imports (only within same module)

- Always use absolute imports for `dataset_forge` modules.

## Memory Management

- Use centralized memory management: `from dataset_forge.utils.memory_utils import clear_memory, clear_cuda_cache`
- Use context managers: `with memory_context("Operation Name"):`
- Use decorators: `@auto_cleanup`, `@monitor_memory_usage`
- Clear memory after large operations.

## Parallel Processing

- Use centralized parallel system: `from dataset_forge.utils.parallel_utils import parallel_map, ProcessingType`
- Use `smart_map`, `image_map`, `batch_map` for optimized processing.

## Progress Tracking & User Feedback

- Use `from dataset_forge.utils.progress_utils import tqdm`
- Use AudioTqdm for audio notifications.
- Always show progress for long operations.

## Color Scheme & UI

- Use Catppuccin Mocha color scheme: `from dataset_forge.utils.color import Mocha`
- Use centralized printing: `print_info`, `print_success`, `print_warning`, `print_error`
- Use `print_header()` and `print_section()` for menu organization.

## Menu System

- Use hierarchical menu structure (7 main categories).
- Use `show_menu()` from `dataset_forge.utils.menu`.
- Include emojis in menu options.
- Handle `KeyboardInterrupt` and `EOFError` gracefully.

## Input Handling

- Use centralized input utilities: `from dataset_forge.utils.input_utils import get_path_with_history, get_folder_path`
- Support path history, favorites, and intelligent defaults.

## File Operations

- Use centralized file utilities: `from dataset_forge.utils.file_utils import is_image_file, get_unique_filename`
- Support all major image formats.
- Handle file operations safely (copy, move, inplace).

## Image Processing

- Use centralized image utilities: `from dataset_forge.utils.image_ops import get_image_size`
- Handle alpha channels properly.
- Use PIL for basic, OpenCV for advanced processing.

## Logging & Error Handling

- Use centralized logging: `from dataset_forge.utils.history_log import log_operation`
- Log all major operations with timestamps.
- Use try-except with meaningful error messages.
- Provide graceful degradation for non-critical errors.
- All user-facing errors must trigger the error sound (error.mp3) via the centralized print_error utility.

## Session State & Configuration

- Use centralized session state: `from dataset_forge.menus.session_state import parallel_config, user_preferences`
- Store user preferences and settings.
- Cache expensive operation results.

## DPID (Degradation) Patterns

- Use centralized DPID utilities: `from dataset_forge.utils.dpid_phhofm import process_image, downscale_folder`
- Support multiple DPID implementations.
- Use parallel processing for efficiency.

## Audio & User Feedback

- Use centralized audio utilities: `from dataset_forge.utils.audio_utils import play_done_sound`
- Play completion sounds for long operations.
- Respect user audio preferences.
- All user-facing errors must trigger the error sound (error.mp3) via the centralized print_error utility.

## Testing & Validation

- Validate input paths and file existence.
- Check image format compatibility.
- Verify HQ/LQ pair alignment.
- Provide detailed error messages.

## Performance Optimization

- Use parallel processing for I/O and CPU.
- Implement batch processing for large datasets.
- Use memory-efficient operations.
- Cache expensive computations.

## Monitoring, Analytics & Error Tracking

- Use centralized monitoring utilities: `from dataset_forge.utils.monitoring import monitor_performance, track_errors, register_background_task, health_check`
- Decorate all user-facing and long-running functions in actions/ with `@monitor_performance` and `@track_errors` for analytics and error tracking
- Register all subprocesses/threads with `register_background_task` for background task management
- Use `health_check()` for RAM, disk, CUDA, and permissions validation
- Ensure persistent logging of analytics and errors to ./logs/
- Trigger notifications (sound/visual) for critical errors
- Integrate memory and CUDA cleanup on exit/errors for all tracked processes/threads
- All monitoring and analytics features must be accessible from the System Monitoring menu

## Error Handling & Recovery

- Catch specific exceptions (`FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`, etc.).
- Provide recovery options when possible.
- Log errors for debugging.
- Continue processing when individual items fail.

## Documentation Requirements

- Google-style docstrings for all public functions/classes.
- Include parameter types, return values, exceptions.
- Provide usage examples in docstrings.

## Security Considerations

- Validate all user inputs.
- Sanitize file paths to prevent path traversal.
- Use safe file operations.
- Handle sensitive data appropriately.

## Dependency Management

- Add new dependencies to `requirements.txt`.
- Use version constraints for stability.
- Document optional dependencies.
- Test with minimal dependency sets.

## Git Ignore Patterns

- See `.gitignore` for patterns.
- Ignore venvs, caches, logs, configs (except examples), results, and user-specific files.

## Final Reminders

1. **Always activate the virtual environment**: `venv312\Scripts\activate`
2. **Always use centralized utilities from `dataset_forge.utils`**
3. **Always include proper error handling and logging**
4. **Always use the Catppuccin Mocha color scheme**
5. **Always follow the modular architecture patterns**
6. **Always implement parallel processing for performance**
7. **Always manage memory properly, especially for CUDA operations**
8. **Always provide user-friendly feedback and progress tracking**
9. **Always document your code with Google-style docstrings**
10. **Always test your changes thoroughly before committing**
11. **All user-facing errors must trigger the error sound (error.mp3) via the centralized print_error utility.**

## üß™ Testing

Dataset Forge now includes a comprehensive, automated test suite covering:

- CLI entry and menu navigation
- Menu timing/profiling
- Error feedback (including audio)
- Memory management and parallel processing
- File and image utilities
- Robust handling of Unicode, subprocess, and Windows-specific issues
- Manual/script-style tests for BHI filtering and pepeline (run directly, not via pytest)

**How to run all tests:**

1. Activate your virtual environment:
   ```sh
   venv312\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Run all automated tests from the project root:
   ```sh
   pytest
   ```
3. To run manual/script tests:
   ```sh
   python tests/test_bhi_filtering.py
   python tests/test_pepeline.py
   ```

All tests pass as of this integration. See [usage.md](usage.md) and [features.md](features.md) for details.

## Menu Timing & Profiling (New in July 2025)

Dataset Forge now features a fast, responsive CLI menu system with built-in timing and profiling:

- Every time you load a menu or submenu, you will see a timing print (e.g., `‚è±Ô∏è Loaded dataset_management_menu in 0.123 seconds.`) in the Catppuccin Mocha color scheme.
- All menu load times are recorded and can be viewed in the System Monitoring menu under "‚è±Ô∏è View Menu Load Times".
- This helps you identify slow-loading menus and provides transparency for performance optimization.
- The timing system uses lazy imports to maximize CLI speed and minimize memory usage.
