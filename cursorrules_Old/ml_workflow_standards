## Dataset Forge ML Workflow Patterns

### Memory Management
```python
from dataset_forge.utils.memory_utils import clear_memory, memory_context, auto_cleanup

@auto_cleanup
def process_ml_dataset(images: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
   Process images for ML training with proper memory management.
    
    Args:
        images: List of image file paths
        
    Returns:
        List of processed image data dictionaries
    "ith memory_context("ML Dataset Processing"):
        results = []
        for image_path in images:
            # Process image
            result = process_single_image(image_path)
            results.append(result)
            clear_memory()  # Clear after each image
        return results
```

### GPU Acceleration
```python
from dataset_forge.utils.gpu_acceleration import gpu_brightness_contrast, gpu_image_analysis

def gpu_enhanced_processing(image: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:Apply GPU-accelerated image transformations.
    
    Args:
        image: Input image tensor
        
    Returns:
        Processed image tensor

    # GPU-accelerated transformations
    result = gpu_brightness_contrast(image, brightness=10.1ontrast=1.2
    # GPU-accelerated analysis
    analysis = gpu_image_analysis(result)
    
    return result
```

### Parallel Processing
```python
from dataset_forge.utils.progress_utils import smart_map, image_map
from dataset_forge.utils.parallel_utils import ProcessingType

def batch_process_images(image_paths: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
   Processimages in parallel with automatic optimization.
    
    Args:
        image_paths: List of image file paths
        
    Returns:
        List of processing results
    "matic optimization based on data type
    results = smart_map(process_image, image_paths, desc=Processing Images")
    
    # Image-specific optimization
    results = image_map(process_image, image_paths, desc=Processing Images)    return results
```

### Caching for ML Operations
```python
from dataset_forge.utils.cache_utils import in_memory_cache, disk_cache, model_cache

@in_memory_cache(ttl=300)  # 5 minutes for frequently accessed data
def extract_features(image_path: str) -> np.ndarray:
    "ract features from image with caching.
    
    Args:
        image_path: Path to image file
        
    Returns:
        Feature vector as numpy array
   Feature extraction logic
    return features

@model_cache(ttl=3600# 1 hour for model loading
def load_ml_model(model_path: str) -> Any:
  Load ML model with caching.
    
    Args:
        model_path: Path to model file
        
    Returns:
        Loaded model
    # Model loading logic
    return model
```

## Coding Guidelines

### 1. Pythonic Practices
- **Elegance and Readability:** Strive for elegant and Pythonic code that is easy to understand and maintain
- **PEP 8mpliance:** Adhere to PEP8delines with Black formatter
- **Explicit over Implicit:** Favor explicit code that clearly communicates its intent
- **Zen of Python:** Keep the Zen of Python in mind when making design decisions

### 2. Modular Design
- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each module/file should have a well-defined, single responsibility
- **Reusable Components:** Develop reusable functions and classes, favoring composition over inheritance
- **Package Structure:** Organize code into logical packages and modules (menus/, actions/, utils/)

###3 Code Quality
- **Comprehensive Type Annotations:** All functions, methods, and class members must have type annotations
- **Detailed Docstrings:** All functions, methods, and classes must have Google-style docstrings
- **Thorough Unit Testing:** Aim for high test coverage using `pytest`
- **Robust Exception Handling:** Use specific exception types with meaningful error messages
- **Logging:** Employ the `logging` module judiciously for important events

###4pecific Guidelines
- **Experiment Configuration:** Use centralized configuration management
- **Data Pipeline Management:** Employ proper data preprocessing and validation
- **Model Versioning:** Utilize proper model checkpoint management
- **Experiment Logging:** Maintain comprehensive logs of experiments
- **Memory Management:** Implement proper memory cleanup for large datasets

### 5. Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Imports:** Use lazy imports for heavy operations
- **Caching:** Apply appropriate caching strategies for expensive operations
- **Resource Monitoring:** Use proper memory and GPU monitoring
- **Memory Efficiency:** Ensure proper release of unused resources
- **Concurrency:** Employ parallel processing for I/O operations

## Dataset Forge Specific Requirements

### Virtual Environment
- **ALWAYS** activate virtual environment: `venv312Scripts\activate`
- **ALWAYS** test new additions in the correct Python environment

### Documentation
- **ALWAYS** update README.md for new features (with user confirmation)
- **ALWAYS** look up documentation for new packages/modules
- **ALWAYS** maintain comprehensive docstrings

### Error Handling
- **ALWAYS** use centralized error utilities
- **ALWAYS** trigger error sounds for user-facing errors
- **ALWAYS** log operations for debugging

### Testing
- **ALWAYS** write comprehensive tests for new features
- **ALWAYS** use pytest (never unittest)
- **ALWAYS** include type annotations in tests
- **ALWAYS** test both success and failure scenarios

## Communication Style

- **Professional and Concise:** Provide clear, actionable guidance
- **Explain Rationale:** When making suggestions, explain the reasoning
- **Consider Trade-offs:** Discuss potential benefits and drawbacks
- **Ask for Clarification:** If requirements are unclear, ask questions
- **Provide Examples:** Include concrete code examples when helpful

## Problem-Solving Approach

1. **Understand the Context:** Analyze the specific Dataset Forge ML use case
2. **Follow Established Patterns:** Use existing utilities and conventions
3. **Consider Performance:** Optimize for large dataset processing
4on User Experience:** Ensure smooth CLI interactions
5 **Test Thoroughly:** Validate functionality and edge cases
6. **Document Changes:** Update relevant documentation
