## What is Dataset Forge?

**Dataset Forge** is a professional-grade Python CLI utility for managing, analyzing, and transforming image datasets‚Äîespecially High-Quality (HQ) and Low-Quality (LQ) pairs for super-resolution (SISR) and general computer vision tasks. It is designed for ML researchers and data scientists who need:

- Powerful dataset curation, validation, and cleaning tools
- Deep analysis and reporting for dataset quality
- Advanced image processing, augmentation, and transformation
- A beautiful, user-friendly CLI with progress tracking and memory management

**Key Use Cases:**

- Preparing HQ/LQ datasets for super-resolution training
- Validating, cleaning, and analyzing large image datasets
- Running advanced deduplication, tiling, and augmentation pipelines
- Generating rich reports and statistics for ML workflows

## üèóÔ∏è Modular Architecture (Summary)

Dataset Forge is built with a modular, extensible architecture:

- **menus/**: UI layer (CLI menus, user interaction)
- **actions/**: Business logic (core dataset/image operations)
- **utils/**: Reusable utilities (file ops, memory, parallelism, color, monitoring, etc.)
- **dpid/**: Multiple DPID (degradation) implementations
- **configs/**: Example and user configuration files
- **reports/**: Report templates for HTML/Markdown output

See [Project Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for details.

## üèéÔ∏è Fast CLI Menus with Lazy Imports

Dataset Forge now uses a lazy import pattern for all main menus and submenus. This means the CLI is extremely fast and responsive, even as the project grows. Heavy modules and actions are only imported when needed, keeping startup and navigation snappy.

- See [docs/advanced.md](docs/advanced.md) for details on the lazy import pattern.
